# ToDo List App

Hi! This is my simple ToDo List app made with Flutter.  
It helps you keep track of tasks you need to do. You can add tasks, mark them as done, edit, and delete them.

## What is this project?

- A list where you can add tasks.
- You can check tasks when you finish them.
- Tasks are saved on your device, so they don’t disappear when you close the app.
- It has a simple and colorful design.

## How does it work?

- It uses `SharedPreferences` to save tasks on your phone.
- Tasks are saved as JSON data.
- Shows your tasks in a list on the screen.
- You can tap on a task to edit it.
- Buttons to delete tasks or mark them as done.

## How to run it?

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed on your computer.  
   (Search “Flutter install” on Google, it’s easy to set up)
2. Download or clone this project to your computer.
3. Open a terminal and go to the project folder.
4. Run `flutter pub get` to download the packages.
5. Run `flutter run` to start the app.

## Ideas to improve

- Add a due date for tasks.
- Set priorities for tasks.
- Make the design look cooler.
